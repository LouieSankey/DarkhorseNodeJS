This is a sample of the Node.js webscrapper that powers my fantasy sports game, Darkhorse.

It consists of 3  Firebase Cloud Functions: one for getting the currently schedule NBA games from cbssports.com,
another for using the schedule to then get the active players, and then another for getting the player's logs. 

My full codebase for the app includes around 25 'cloud functions' deployed to google cloud, as well as a robust Firestore databse
and a native iOS cient app. 

This sample code shows my clean handling of making multiple nested https requests with promises, promis.all(). async/await, 
and the javascript map and reduce functions.
