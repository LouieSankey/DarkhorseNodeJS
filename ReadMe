This is a sample of the Node.js webscrapper that powers my fantasy sports game, Darkhorse.

It consists of 3  Firebase Cloud Functions:

First, getSchedule makes a request to CBS sports and scrapes schedule data for upcoming NBA games.

Second, getPlayers reads the schedule data from Firebase and makes a new http request to the 
TEAM page of every team with upcoming game. This results in only getting info for players with upcoming games.

Third, for every player with an upcoming game, I make an additional request to that players 
individual page to get the players photo url, and previous game logs. 

My full codebase for the app includes around 20-25 cloud functions, with various tasks like managing contests,
importing real time stats, and calculating scores. 

This is only a sample to show my use of Node.js, promise chaining, async await, promise.map,
and some third party libraries like request-promise, moment.js, and cheerio (for webcrawling).
